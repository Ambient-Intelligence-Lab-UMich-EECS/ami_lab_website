Committed to the vision of "ambient intelligence", my research delves into the creation of end-to-end intelligent, cost-effective, deployable, and human-centric sensing systems for Mobile, Wearable and IoT ecosystems. Specifically, we will i). Enable novel applications; ii). Advance computational sensing techniques; iii). Address system bottlenecks; and iv). Harness innovative sensing modalities for MWIoT ecosystems.

My work has won the ACM IMWUT (UbiComp) Distinguished Paper Award and ACM SenSys Best Poster Runner-up. The tangible impact of my research is also manifested in real-world applications, with successful deployments on widely-recognized IoT devices such as Amazon Echo and Google Home. Additionaly, I'm privileged to have been chosen as the Google Ph.D. Fellowship (the sole recipient in Mobile Computing area among candidates in North America and Europe).
