Hi, I’m Hyunmin Park, a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. My research explores human–computer interaction and sensing technologies, with a focus on rethinking existing sensors to capture complex human behaviors and health signals. I have developed systems such as HandSAW, a wrist-worn device that leverages surface acoustic waves for robust activity recognition, SAWECG, which reconstructs ECG waveforms from subtle acoustic heart signals for cost-effective cardiac monitoring, and ISOMIC, a 49-channel microphone array for sound localization and classification in real-world environments. My goal is to design practical, deployable sensing systems that combine novel sensor modalities with machine learning to enhance everyday life through health monitoring, activity recognition, and smart environments.
